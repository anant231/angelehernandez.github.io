    <p>
        I'm Angel Hernandez, a computer engineering sophomore at
        Northwestern University (class of '21). I'm one of the two Co-Chairs
        for NU's Homecoming 2019 Committee because I love the Wildcats,
        and I wanted to help contribute to spreading the purple pride.

        I also play a lot of video games, including Rocket League, Rainbow Six:
        Siege, and Warframe. I tend to play them a lot in individual 
        bursts of activity. Then I get bored and play a lot of another
        game for a while.
