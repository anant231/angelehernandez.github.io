                <!-- Detailed Bio Block -->
                <p>I was born in 1999, when it was uncommon to find cell
                  phones with cameras. Now, I am 21 years old, and it is
                  seemingly impossible to find a cell phone without a camera.
                  I have always been fascinated with technology and have not
                  only watched but experienced its exponential growth.<br>
                  <br>
                  While I have been interested in technology all my life, I
                  only truly started tinkering with computers during the
                  latter years of high school when I put together a personal
                  gaming computer. I researched, planned, and purchased the
                  necessary computer parts within my budget and put it all
                  together with a close friend. Since then, I have upgraded
                  every individual part of that computer, and I have seen the
                  direct result of those upgrades on my system every time.
                  There is nothing more rewarding than starting with a weaker
                  build and progressively upgrading parts to new industry
                  standards, especially when the industry is as explosive as
                  technology.<br>
                  <br>
                  I love putting computers together now, and I love helping
                  other people putting their computers together. I believe
                  putting together a computer is truly the first milestone in
                  understanding how hardware and software work together to
                  produce a functional operating system.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am happy to be studying a field I have grown up with, and
                  I am excited to see what I can do to change the future of
                  technology. I am currently in search of a full-time,
                  entry-level software developer role, so please reach out if
                  you have any opportunities for me, or if you'd just like to
                  have a chat.
